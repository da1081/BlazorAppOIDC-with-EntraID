# BlazorApp OIDC with Entra ID

Had a hard time figuring out how to setup Open ID Connect with a BlazorApp in Hybrid mode. 

I found [this repository](https://github.com/dotnet/blazor-samples/tree/main/8.0/BlazorWebAppOidc) which did just that. 

I then set out to create my own version to better understand how it was made. This is that version.
